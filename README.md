# HTM

A simple implementation of Spherical HTM (Hierarchical Triangular Mesh)<sup>[1]</sup>.

Divide a unit sphere into triangular meshes (called Trixels), forming an indexing system similar to a quadtree.

The system is able to execute range queries by covering a spherical region by a set of Trixels.

_Still under developing._
